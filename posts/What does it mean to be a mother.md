At the moment I am a proud mother of the most wonderful child in the world also known as Vladislav and preganant with my second son who I believe is going to be as much wonderful.

So, I already have 1,5 year of motherhood experience. It's time to answer some questions to myself.
What does it mean for me?
Is it the same as I expected?
Am I a "достаточно хорошая мать"?
Do I love my baby enough?
Is it cool to work leaving baby to his grand parents or babysitter.
How does my live changed?
