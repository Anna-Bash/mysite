Hi, my name is Anna Bashkuev and I'm .. **frontend developer**.
Here is my list of cool things about my job.
- **Working from home** I have my comfortable workplace with all cookies I can eat. I can here what's going on with my child downsatirs (which also could be a downside). And I don't need to spend some valubale time of my life in crowded public transport (the only part I miss there is reading on the train or bus).
- **Not bad salary** Salaries in IT world could be enormous, but I'm not satisfied with my own rate though.
- **Respect of the society**. Some people aactually think that I'm very smart. It's also cool to be a women in such field. Society respect just doubles on this fact. At least that is my feeling.
- **Creating things**. When you do something it's always wonderful to see some outcome. In my field I can actually show the result of my work, eventhough the whole complexity stays under the water to normal user.
